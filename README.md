## YM_MINI

A USB Controlled mini synthesizer based on the Yamaha YM2149 IC

This project was originally released on February 27th of 2014. It is available here for reference and is no longer maintained, though I'll be happy to answer questions about it!

#### Description

The YM_MINI uses a virtual midi driver and a built-in Arduino circuit to fully control a real YM2149 chip in stereo.

The chip is most well known for its use in the Apple II Mockingbird soundcards and Atari ST computers. The YM or the chip from which it was derived (GI’s AY-3-8910) also created the music and audio in the Intellivision, Vectrex, some MSX systems, Sinclair ZX and Spectrum home computers, and many arcade machines.

The synth can be played via a live controller like monome or Oxygen8, or any midi-capable software such as Logic-Pro, Energy-XT, FL_Studio, Reaktor, Reaper, Max/MSP, PureData, Renoise, — pretty much anything that can sequence midi!
